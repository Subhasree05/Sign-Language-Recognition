# Sign-Language-Recognition
Hand Sign Recognition is a computer vision system that interprets human hand gestures using a camera. It extracts hand landmarks, feeds them into a trained machine learning model, and recognizes specific signs or letters. This technology can be used for sign language translation, gesture-based controls, and human-computer interaction.
